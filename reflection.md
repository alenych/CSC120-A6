- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I personally enjoyed using inheritance because it made the code much more consice and organized. Using inheritance proved to be efficient because it minimized redundancy in the code and it made it easier to edit the code in base class and have the changes applied.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- I would advise other students to start this assignment early and also to work with others to collaborate with ideas because it is a hard concept to grasp initially but the outcome is so beneficial.
